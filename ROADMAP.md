## Scan categories

| Scan | Reusable workflow status | Pre-commit hook status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secret scanning | Pilot (v0.1.0) — [`.github/workflows/secret-scan-pulse.yml`](.github/workflows/secret-scan-pulse.yml) | Pilot (v0.1.0) — `secret-scan-trufflehog` published in [`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`](.pre-commit-hooks.yaml) | Pulse is the CI enforcement lane (runs the Pulse image on `nv-gha-runners`); OSS TruffleHog is the local pre-commit advisory lane. |
